🎆 Diwali Sales Analysis 📊
📌 Project Overview:

The Diwali Sales Analysis project aims to extract meaningful business insights from a retail dataset containing Diwali festival sales data. The dataset includes customer demographics, product categories, purchase amounts, and transaction details. This project focuses on analyzing the sales patterns during the festive season to support data-driven decisions related to marketing, inventory management, and customer segmentation.

🚀 Objectives:

Clean and preprocess the raw data for consistency and accuracy.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior and product trends.

Identify key customer segments based on age, gender, location, and occupation.

Pinpoint top-selling product categories and high-demand products.

Assist businesses in inventory planning, marketing strategies, and customer targeting using data insights.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:

Python	          : Core programming language for scripting and analysis.

Jupyter Notebook  :	Environment for interactive coding, visualizations, and step-by-step documentation.

Pandas            :	For data manipulation, cleaning, aggregation, and preprocessing.

Matplotlib        :	For visualizing univariate and bivariate analysis through bar plots, histograms, etc.

Seaborn           :	For advanced visualizations and heatmaps to explore correlations and trends.

📊 Key Steps in the Project:

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
   
Removed null values and irrelevant columns to ensure clean data for analysis.

Converted data types appropriately (e.g., age groups to categories, purchase amounts to numeric).

Handled missing or inconsistent entries to maintain data integrity.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   
Used various plots to analyze customer distribution by gender, age, city, and occupation.

Visualized purchase behavior across different segments.

Highlighted trends such as:

Higher purchase amounts by specific gender/age groups.

Most active cities in terms of Diwali sales.

Occupations contributing most to total sales.

3. Customer Segmentation:
   
Grouped customers based on:

Age group

Gender
